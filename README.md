# Fitness-AQA

The main objective of this project is to make a contribution to the ongoing research in error detection within real-world gym exercises. This will be achieved by applying and adapting various architectures to a recently introduced [fitness AQA dataset](https://forms.gle/PbPTX1eVxGpa3QG88).
